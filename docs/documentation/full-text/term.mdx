title: Term Search
---

## Basic Usage

Searches for the presence of a specific [term](/documentation/concepts/term).

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes';
```

If the provided term can be tokenized further, the tokenization is automatically applied at search time using the same tokenizer
as the prefixed field.

## Multiple Terms

`AND` and `OR` can be used to combine and filter multiple terms.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'keyboard' OR category @@@ 'toy';
```

If multiple terms are passed into the same query string, they are `OR`ed together by default.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'keyboard headphones';
```

## Not Term

`-` omits results that contain a specific term. The following query finds documents that match
`shoes` or `running` but not `white`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ '(shoes running -white)';
```

## Special Characters

The special characters `+` , `^`, `` ` ``, `:`, `{`, `}`, `"`, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, `<`, `>`,`~`, `!`, `\\`, `\*`, and `SPACE` must
be escaped by a `\` inside the query term.

## How match queries work

The match query works by analyzing the input text, breaking it into the tokens using the specified or default analyzer. These tokens are then compared with the indexed terms, and only the documents where the indexed terms match these tokens are included in the search results.

For example, if the query is "shoes white" and the default analyzer is used, it will produce two tokens: "shoes" and "white".

```sql
SELECT * FROM paradedb.tokenize(
  paradedb.tokenizer('default'),
  'shoes white'
);
```

These tokens are then matched against the indexed terms, and only documents containing indexed terms that match either "shoes" or "white" in the relevant fields will be considered in the search results
